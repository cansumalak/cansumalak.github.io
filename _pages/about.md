I am currently studying Master's Degree in South Korea as a Global Korean Scholarship (GKS) Scholar. My main goal is to contribute to the literature with new findings of human perception while paving the way for more intelligent artificial systems. I believe that, in order to create intelligent systems, it is essential to keep up with the pace of our rapidly changing world and investigate new situations such as the COVID-19, which affects our daily lives in many ways. 

My great passion for understanding the human mind led me to learn more about cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques in detail. More specifically, I am interested in face perception, emotion recognition and audiovisual perception, as well as human-robot interaction. I worked on a project called [“Audio-visual Mechanisms of The Uncanny Valley Effect”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-186-2/) as a part of the CNVP Lab. 

Currently, I am working on my research project titled [“Effects of Perceived Gaze Direction and Face Mask on Emotion Recognition – An Eye-Tracking Study”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-effects-of-perceived-gaze-direction-and-face-mask-on-face-perception/) granted by TUBITAK which is the leading scientific committee for research in Turkey. This project will reveal perceived gaze direction and face masks’ effects on recognition of facial cues of emotion while analyzing eye-tracker data and manipulating gaze direction and facial expressions of facial stimuli. 

My hobbies apart from my interest in academia; are taekwondo, hapkido, yoga, and getting to know new cultures!
