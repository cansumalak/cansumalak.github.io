I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Brain and Cognitive Engineering at Korea University under Professor Christian Wallraven, supported by the Global Korean Scholarship (GKS). 

My research primarily focuses on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying facial recognition, emotion perception, and social attention, with a particular focus on how ambiguous cues influence human perception. I am currently investigating whether Koreans can distinguish between Korean, Chinese, and Japanese faces and compare human performance with machine learning models in fine-grained ethnicity recognition.

Outside of academia, I enjoy practising taekwondo, hapkido, and yoga and exploring new cultures.
