I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Brain and Cognitive Engineering at Korea University under Professor Christian Wallraven, supported by the Global Korean Scholarship (GKS). My research primarily focuses on facial recognition, emotion recognition, and perceived gaze direction. I am currently investigating whether Koreans can distinguish between Korean, Chinese, and Japanese faces. This work aims to enhance our understanding of human perception and its implications for developing more intelligent artificial systems. My academic interests include face perception, emotion recognition, audiovisual perception, and human-robot interaction. Outside of academia, I enjoy practicing taekwondo, hapkido, yoga, and exploring new cultures.
