I am a Psychology and Sociology double major student at Yeditepe University. My great passion for understanding the human mind led me to learn more about cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques in detail. More specifically, I am interested in visual and auditory perception, as well as human-robot interaction. I worked on a project called [“Audio-visual Mechanisms of The Uncanny Valley Effect”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-186-2/) as a part of the CNVP Lab. 

Currently, I am working on my research project titled [“Effects of Perceived Gaze Direction and Face Mask on Emotion Recognition – An Eye-Tracking Study”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-effects-of-perceived-gaze-direction-and-face-mask-on-face-perception/) granted by TUBITAK which is the leading scientific committee for research in Turkey. This project will reveal perceived gaze direction and face masks’ effects on recognition of facial cues of emotion while analyzing eye-tracker data and manipulating gaze direction and facial expressions of photographs. 


My hobbies apart from my interest in academia; are taekwondo, hapkido, yoga, and getting to know new cultures!
