**About Me**

I am currently a Master’s candidate at Korea University in the Brain and Cognitive Engineering department under the supervision of Professor Christian Wallraven, supported by the Global Korean Scholarship (GKS). My research focuses on investigating the fine-grained distinctions in facial recognition, specifically exploring whether Koreans can distinguish between Korean, Chinese, and Japanese faces. This study aims to contribute to our understanding of human perception and its implications for more intelligent artificial systems. I believe that keeping up with the pace of our rapidly changing world and exploring new situations, such as the impact of COVID-19 on daily life, is essential in this field.

My great passion for understanding the human mind has led me to delve deeply into cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques. I am particularly interested in face perception, emotion recognition, and audiovisual perception, as well as human-robot interaction. Previously, I worked on a project titled [“Audio-visual Mechanisms of The Uncanny Valley Effect”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-186-2/) as part of the CNVP Lab. Additionally, I recently completed a TUBITAK-funded research project titled [“Effects of Perceived Gaze Direction and Face Mask on Emotion Recognition – An Eye-Tracking Study”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-effects-of-perceived-gaze-direction-and-face-mask-on-face-perception/) which explored how perceived gaze direction and face masks influence the recognition of emotional facial cues. Outside of academia, I enjoy practicing taekwondo, hapkido, yoga, and learning about new cultures.
