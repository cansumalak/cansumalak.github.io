  I am happy to share that my first first-author journal article, *Pupillary responses to masked and gaze-averted faces*, has been published in *Frontiers in Psychology*.  

  I presented our work *Humans versus machines: Distinguishing Korean, Chinese, and Japanese faces via internal and external features* at the Vision Sciences Society (VSS) 2025.  

  I presented our study on the importance of external facial features in fine-grained ethnicity categorization at the Korean Cognitive and Biological Psychology Society Conference 2025. Believe it or not, in Korean! e  

  I obtained TOPIK Level 6, the highest level of Korean language proficiency.  

  I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Brain and Cognitive Engineering from Korea University.
