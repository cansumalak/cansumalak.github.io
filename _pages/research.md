My senior year project focuses on the perceived gaze direction and face masksâ€™ effects on recognition of facial cues of emotion while analyzing eye-tracker data and manipulating gaze direction and facial expressions of photographs. 



More specifically, I am interested in visual and auditory perception, face perception, emotion recognition, and cognition.
