My senior year project focuses on the perceived gaze direction and face masks’ effects on recognition of facial cues of emotion while analyzing eye-tracker data and manipulating gaze direction and facial expressions of photographs. 

During the first year of my sociology major, I was fascinated by understanding the human mind thanks to first-year psychology courses. Thus, I realized my passion for being researcher. While trying to explore my main interest topic in research, I also took courses such as “Affective Neuroscience,” “Artificial Intelligence for Interdisciplinary Researches,” “Python,” “Cognitive Research Methods with Arduino,” “Research in Social Cognition.” I believe different course that I take equipped me with solid background and intellectual curiosity necessary to be a successful researcher. Since then, I have been trying to understand how the human mind works and adapt new findings to the field.

More specifically, I am interested in visual and auditory perception, face perception, emotion recognition, and cognition.
