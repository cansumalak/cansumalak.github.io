My doctoral work draws on the fields of human computer interaction (HCI), computer- supported cooperative work (CSCW), knowledge and information management to
understand how individuals and organizations interact with information and sociotechnical systems in low-resource environments, including humanitarian and settlement contexts.

I am also interested in how people individually and collaboratively access to and use of health information. In my mixed-method MA research, I explored the use of Facebook in disseminating and curating critical health information by health non-profit organizations.

As a researcher, I am driven to empower non-dominant, underrepresented, and marginalized communities by designing information and new technologies that have a positive impact in their lives.

I enjoy collaborating with researchers across a variety of disciplines to explore complex interplay between information, technology, and society. I am interested in qualitative and critical and mixed method research methodologies.
