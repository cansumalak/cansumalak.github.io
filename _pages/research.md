My senior year project focuses on the perceived gaze direction and face masksâ€™ effects on recognition of facial cues of emotion while analyzing eye-tracker data and manipulating gaze direction and facial expressions of photographs. 

Thanks to different courses that consider the brain with different viewpoints such as physiological, biological, cognitive, clinical, or social psychology, I realized my strong passion for research to explore the brain. Besides this, they also helped me build a solid background to understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive functions, mind, and brain. Since then, I have been trying to understand how the human mind works and adapt new findings to the field.

More specifically, I am interested in visual and auditory perception, face perception, emotion recognition, and cognition.
