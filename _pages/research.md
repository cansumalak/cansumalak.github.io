My senior bachelor project, [“Effects of Perceived Gaze Direction and Face Mask on Emotion Recognition – An Eye-Tracking Study”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-effects-of-perceived-gaze-direction-and-face-mask-on-face-perception/) funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), examined how perceived gaze direction and mask usage influence the recognition of emotional facial cues using eye-tracking technology. This study aimed to understand how emotion recognition patterns change in mask-wearing environments and to improve emotion recognition algorithms for masked faces by identifying key facial regions and the role of gaze direction in this process.

Previously, as an undergraduate research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Funda Yıldırım in the [Computational Neuroscience Visual Perception (CNVP)](https://cnvplab.com/) laboratory at Yeditepe University's Department of Computer Engineering, I worked on the [“Audio-visual Mechanisms of The Uncanny Valley Effect”](https://cnvplab.com/https-cnvplab-com-projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-visual-crowding-in-holistic-configurations/projects-short-term-plasticity-in-bistable-phonetic-word-processing-186-2/) This project explored how different levels of naturality in visual-auditory stimuli affect human-robot interaction (HRI) and the perception of the Uncanny Valley effect across generations. 

Currently, I am working under the guidance of Professor Christian Wallraven in the [Cognitive Systems Lab](https://cogsyslab.notion.site/) at Korea University, where I am investigating whether Koreans can distinguish between Korean, Chinese, and Japanese faces. This research focuses on fine-grained distinctions in facial recognition to enhance our understanding of human perception and its implications for developing more intelligent artificial systems.

Throughout my academic journey, I have realized the transformative potential of interdisciplinary studies in cognitive science. To broaden my knowledge, I have taken courses such as “Artificial Intelligence for Interdisciplinary Researches” and “Cognitive Research Methods with Arduino,” which have equipped me with a robust foundation in psychology and interdisciplinary research. These experiences have fueled my intellectual curiosity and passion for understanding the human mind, driving me to continuously adapt new findings to my field of study.

My primary research interests include face perception, emotion recognition, visual and auditory perception and cognition.
