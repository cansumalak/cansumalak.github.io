My doctoral work draws on the fields of human computer interaction (HCI), computer-
supported cooperative work (CSCW), knowledge and information management to
understand how individuals and organizations interact with information and
sociotechnical systems in low-resource environments, including humanitarian and
settlement contexts.
I am also interested in how people individually and collaboratively access to and use of
health information. In my mixed-method MA research, I explored the use of Facebook in
disseminating and curating critical health information by health non-profit organizations.
As a researcher, I am driven to empower non-dominant, underrepresented, and
marginalized communities by designing information and new technologies that have a
positive impact in their lives.
I enjoy collaborating with researchers across a variety of disciplines to explore complex
interplay between information, technology, and society. I am interested in qualitative
and critical and mixed method research methodologies.
