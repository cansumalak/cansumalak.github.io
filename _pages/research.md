My senior year project focuses on the effect of surgical masks on emotion recognition called "Effects of Perceived Gaze Direction and Face Mask on Emotion Recognition - An Eye-Tracking Study," which was granted by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). This study aims to examine the effect of perceived gaze direction and mask use on the recognition of facial emotion cues using eye-tracking technology. As a result of the study, it will be possible to get an idea about how emotion recognition patterns change in mask-wearing environments, as well as how to make changes in emotion recognition algorithms for masked faces, by determining the regions that are considered during emotion recognition in masked faces, and the role of gaze direction in this process. 

While working as an undergraduate research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Funda Yıldırım in the Computational Neuroscience Visual Perception (CNVP) laboratory, I became aware of my enthusiasm in face perception, emotion recognition, and multisensory perception, as well as human-robot interaction. After realizing that interdisciplinary studies in cognitive science can lead to revolutions in the domain, I took courses to improve my knowledge in other areas related to cognitive science, such as "Artificial Intelligence for Interdisciplinary Researches," and "Cognitive Research Methods with Arduino." These courses enabled me to advance my knowledge about the developments in psychology and in the interdisciplinary area. I believe different course that I take equipped me with solid background and intellectual curiosity necessary to be a successful researcher. Since then, I have been trying to understand how the human mind works and adapt new findings to the field.

More specifically, I am interested in visual and auditory perception, face perception, emotion recognition, and cognition.
